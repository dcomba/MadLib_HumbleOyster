Once upon a time there was a humble oyster. He performed so many SILLY (adjective) services, just by living life!
To eat, he DRINK (verb) water, providing clean and clear water for all other ANIMALS (plural noun) to enjoy.
The clear water let grasses grow, which supplied OXYGEN  (noun) and nursery habitat for many organisms. 
When he and his fellow oysters HANG (verb) to form a reef, they stabilized sediments, protecting the REEF (noun) from erosion.
The reef also provided habitat and shelter for hundreds of other creatures, including crabs, fish, and UGLY (adjective) invertebrates.
Along with all of the ecosystem services the SMART (adjective) oyster provided, he also was economically important as a food source.
Just by LIVING (verb ending in -ing), the oyster is beneficial to humans and the environment, making him the most FAMOUS (adjective) creature around.
