Once upon a time there was a humble oyster. He performed so many (fancy) services, just by living life!
To eat, he (swallowed) water, providing clean and clear water for all other (creatures) to enjoy.
The clear water let grasses grow, which supplied (food) and nursery habitat for many organisms. 
When he and his fellow oysters (worked) to form a reef, they stabilized sediments, protecting the (ocean) from erosion.
The reef also provided habitat and shelter for hundreds of other creatures, including crabs, fish, and (sea-dwelling) invertebrates.
Along with all of the ecosystem services the (infamous) oyster provided, he also was economically important as a food source.
Just by (living), the oyster is beneficial to humans and the environment, making him the most (awesome) creature around.
